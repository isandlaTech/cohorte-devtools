# cohorte

This is the root package of the Python implementation of the Cohorte Runtime project. It manages a distributed application based on  service-oriented components.

**Note:** the ``cohorte.genfolders`` module is not maintained, as it has been replaced by the scripts in the [cohorte-platforms](https://github.com/isandlaTech/cohorte-platforms) project.
This script downloads and extracts the Cohorte Home directory from the servers of isandlaTech (by default). It can also download and extract a template for a Cohorte Base directory.
